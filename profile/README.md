## **Product Description**

**Content Warning** is already wild — you and your crew dive into creepy environments, trying to record footage for those precious views. But sometimes, the game can get *too* punishing: limited stamina, sudden jumpscares, and unavoidable deaths. That’s where the **Cheat** comes in.

This cheat isn’t just about “winning” — it’s about freedom. Want infinite stamina so you can run around endlessly? Invincibility so nothing can touch you? Or maybe no oxygen limit so you can chill underwater as long as you want? This mod makes it happen.

With a few tweaks, you can turn Content Warning into a giant sandbox of weird, chaotic, and unforgettable moments with your squad.
